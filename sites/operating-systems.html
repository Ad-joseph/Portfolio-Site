<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<hr>

<p>
An operating system is a type of computer software that manages most of it’s
memory and data processes. It is required to run any computer program and also
gains control over system hardware. Users are able to interact with computers
easier if an operating system is installed, as typically they are met with a GUI
(graphical user interface). There are three most popular operating systems:
, Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.

<h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>

</div>

<p>
Windows is a WIMP environment, meaning window, icon, menu, pointer. This simplifies an
operating system down so it is easier for the user to navigate and control. It is developed
by Microsoft Corporation and it is sold under license. The first version of Windows was
just an application, hosted on the MS-DOS operating system. Any IBM compatible machine
usually runs Windows. Windows offers minimal access to customization, however does offer
a much more user friendly environment and is great for people who have little computer
knowledge. The security isn’t the best as hackers often target computers that run Windows.
This means that updates are important, which is why Microsoft has changed the way that users
update their software. Much like following Apple, instead of buying the new version they
can just download the new one as long as they had purchased a license originally.

<h2>Mac OS X</h2>

<p>
  The MAC operating system is a parallel system that was developed by Apple. It was designed
  for users who didn’t want to follow the IBM-PC hardware configuration.  Mac OS is suited
  for people who like well designed, easy access computing. The security included is one of
  the best and the support given to the user is great. Whenever the OS gets updated the user
  simply has to download the new one.

<h2>Linux</h2>

</div>


<p>
Linux is a Unix based operating system that is free and open source to anyone. It was developed
by Linus Torvalds with the assistance of developers from all over the globe. It is a powerful
operating system because this risk of it being hacked is little. You are able to configure any part
of the OS you like. It is often low cost and most popularly used within servers. Multiuser and
multitasking is supported and can run smoothly on personal computers. Users who like to customize
their interface and want complete control over their computer are more suited towards having a Linux
operating system. However if you don’t have much computer knowledge you may struggle as it involves
a lot of technical aspects when configuring it. Also the system only ever gets updated every six
months so support for the user is smaller than its competitors. The security of the OS is one of
the best as hackers know that linux isn’t widely used.
