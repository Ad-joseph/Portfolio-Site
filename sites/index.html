  A computer is an electronic machine comprising of both hardware components and software.
  With these joined together, computers have the ability to manipulate and translate data
  into actions to perform. The hardware makes up its physical structure, including multiple
  different components that specialise in performing different tasks.  For example, the CPU
  (central processing unit) will receive the most amount of data to translate into action.
  Software is a prerequisite of hardware, and hardware on its own would have limited
  functionality.
</p>

<p>
  The word ‘computer’ does not exclusively refer to well known personal computers such as
  , laptops and tablets, but to any device which has these two principal characteristics:
  “It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute
  a prerecorded list of instructions (a program)” (webopedia [no date]). Meaning that any
  machine which reacts to inputted data and successfully executes the outcome can be called
  a computer. Some examples being: ATM machines, self-checkout machines, automatic doors
  and more.
</p>

<p>
  Smart phones and games consoles also adhere to the two principles. Both are good examples
  of the varying functionality that can be performed by computers; be it portability sending
  text messages, web browsing, or playing high-intensive games while talking to friends over
  the internet.
</p>
<p>
  Computers today have a profound involvement in our everyday lives and environment. They
  help us stay healthy with wearable technology recording our heart rate, calculating if
  exercise had been achieved that day. Keeping us informed with current news with real
  time social media updates on our phones. Entertain us with Smart TV’s, and keep us safe
  with CCTV cameras.
