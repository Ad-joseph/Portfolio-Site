<h1>Applications</h1>
<p>
  Computers are used primarily to achieve a purpose, and it is up for users to
  decide for themselves what that purpose may be. With a variety of computing
  machines being sold to consumers such as tablets, macbooks and PC’s, users
  are having to think about what type of device is best suited to their needs.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of applications, users may side more heavily toward a type of computer
  to another depending on whether they work best with the device. One example of
  this could be if a user wanted a computing machine with easy multitasking
  functionality, they may choose to purchase an Apple macbook. The most recent
  operating system comes with a personal digital assistant; Siri. As the assistant
  was created by Apple to serve their users, it is not available on any other
  operating system.
</p>
<p>
  Other aspects such as customizability could be a deciding factor for some;
  gamers in particular. A survey conducted by ‘Statista’ found that at a games
  development conference; “53% of the 4,500 game developers surveyed said they
  are currently working on a game for the PC or Mac”. One reasoning behind this
  could be that PC’s offer users the ability to upgrade their components freely
  and easily. Evidence of this could been seen in another survey by a company
  named ‘EEDAR’. They wanted to see what PC gamers liked best about the platform.
  Of all respondents; 35% agreed that they like the fact there is more control
  over hardware. So in this instance, games consoles fall short.
